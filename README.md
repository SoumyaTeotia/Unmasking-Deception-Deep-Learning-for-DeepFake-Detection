# DeepFake Detection 
With the proliferation of deepfake technology, there's a pressing need for robust detection systems to combat misinformation and fraudulent content. Our project employs custom CNN architectures, Error Level Analysis (ELA), data augmentation, batch normalization, fine-tuning with pre-trained models, early stopping, and systematic experimentation to enhance detection accuracy.
